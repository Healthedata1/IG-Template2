- use this for ig.ini file

    [IG]
    ig = input/sdc.xml
    template = hl7.fhir.template

-  to run add to jar this option  -ig.ini

- see sdc for example how to run
- why do I need a `ignoreWarnings.txt` if I don't want to ignore any  - dafault to none if not there
- what is :  `properties.txt` ? is this for _config.yml?

    ```

need to add extension for spreadsheets to ig.xml file

- do I need a license file or is that a git hub thing?
- I don't think I need the .bat files since I use bash
- what do the transforms do?  Do they do the same as the layouts?
- need to add a url path to examples and resources so not bound to id name - extension?
- needed to add depends on to ig.xml this causes an error

~~~
<dependsOn>  <!-- 0..* Another Implementation guide this depends on -->
 <uri><!-- 1..1 canonical(ImplementationGuide) Identity of the IG that this depends on --></uri>
 <packageId value="[id]"/><!-- 0..1 NPM Package name for IG this depends on -->
 <version value="[string]"/><!-- 0..1 Version of the IG -->
</dependsOn>

this causes an error:

add globals too

- getting IG canonical is a pain in the ass  - need to download the  package - suggest publishing in the footer I mean why do we need both the package and the canonical here?
- forcing files names to be the same a ids is a pain in the ass - should be able to specifyt the url
- need to autocreate the IG resource from the file tree and source data
- dependency name/code should be an element or an extension.  using the id element is a kludge.
- need layouts to avoid needless repetition in the templates
- rethink the folder names and file tree it should mirror the ig page structure and use html source file name conventions. (pick one)
- frame needs an example list generator, copy-me.html, examplebuttons, schematron-list-generator, img formatters, and a toc-generator
- assume no front matter
